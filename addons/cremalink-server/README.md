> [!NOTE] 
> This project was developed with a result-oriented approach, primarily optimized for the De'Longhi PrimaDonna Soul. While the architecture is designed to be extensible, some logic may currently be tightly coupled to this specific model and might not work seamlessly with others yet.
>The goal is to make the library fully generic. If you notice parts that are too specific to the PrimaDonna Soul or encounter issues with other machines, we highly encourage contributions! Refactoring and generalizations are very welcome to improve support for a wider range of devices.
